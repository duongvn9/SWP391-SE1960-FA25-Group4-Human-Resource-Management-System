## Understanding Leave Balance

### Balance Components

Your leave balance consists of several components:

```

## Common Validation Errors

### 1. Overlapping Leave Requests

**Error Message**:
```

```

**What it means**: You already have a leave request (pending or approved) that overlaps with the dates you're trying to request.

**How to fix**:
- Check your existing requests
- Choose different dates
- Cancel or modify the conflicting request first

**Example**:
```
Existing: Jan 10-15 (APPROVED)
New Request: Jan 12-18 ‚ùå (overlaps on Jan 12-15)
Alternative: Jan 20-25 ‚úÖ (no overlap)
```

---

### 2. Insufficient Leave Balance

**Error Message**:
```

```

**What it means**: You don't have enough leave days remaining for your request.

**How to fix**:
- Request fewer days
- Wait until next year when balance resets
- Consider using a different leave type (e.g., Unpaid Leave)

**Example**:
```
Total Allowed: 12 days
Used: 10 days
Remaining: 2 days

```

### 3. OT Conflict

```

**What it means**: You have an approved overtime request on one of the days you're trying to take leave.

**How to fix**:
- Cancel the OT request first
- Choose different leave dates that don't include the OT day
- Contact your manager to resolve the conflict

**Example**:
```
OT Request: Jan 12 (APPROVED, 2 hours)
Leave Request: Jan 10-15 ‚ùå (includes Jan 12)

### 4. Advance Notice Not Met

**Error Message**:
```
Annual Leave requires at least 3 days advance notice (current notice: 1 days)
```

**What it means**: You're trying to request leave too close to the start date.

**How to fix**:
- Choose a start date further in the future
- Use a leave type with shorter notice requirements (e.g., Sick Leave)
- Contact your manager for emergency situations

**Example**:
```
Today: Jan 10
Requested Start: Jan 12 ‚ùå (only 2 days notice, need 3)
Alternative Start: Jan 14 ‚úÖ (4 days notice)

**How to fix**:
- Split your request into multiple shorter requests
- Use a different leave type with higher limits
- Contact HR for special circumstances

**Example**:
```
Max Consecutive: 5 days
Requested: 7 days ‚ùå
Alternative: Two requests of 3 and 4 days ‚úÖ
```

---

### 6. Past Date Request

**Error Message**:
