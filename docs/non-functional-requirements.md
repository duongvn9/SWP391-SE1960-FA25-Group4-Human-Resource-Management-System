Database query execution times shall not exceed 50ms for simple queries, 200ms for complex JOIN operations, and 2 seconds for report generation queries. The system shall support 100 concurrent users under normal load, 300 users during peak periods, and a maximum of 500 users, with corresponding transaction throughput of 50, 150, and 250 transactions per second respectively. Peak load scenarios include 200 logins per minute during morning hours (8–9 AM) and 500 attendance check-ins within 30 minutes. Database capacity shall accommodate 5GB for one year of data, 15GB for three years, with a maximum capacity of 50GB. Under normal load conditions, resource utilization shall remain below 40% CPU, 60% memory, 50MB/s disk I/O, and 10Mbps network bandwidth, with database connection pool configured for 20 connections and 5–10 active connections.

#### 4.2.3 Reliability

The system shall maintain high reliability through robust error handling, data integrity mechanisms, and fault tolerance capabilities to minimize service disruptions and data loss. The application shall implement comprehensive exception handling with graceful degradation, ensuring that component failures do not cascade to other system modules. Database transactions shall utilize ACID properties with proper rollback mechanisms to maintain data consistency during concurrent operations. The system shall perform automated daily backups with a recovery point objective (RPO) of 24 hours and recovery time objective (RTO) of 4 hours. Error rates shall not exceed 0.5% of total transactions, and the mean time between failures (MTBF) shall be at least 720 hours (30 days). All critical operations including payroll processing, attendance recording, and leave approvals shall include audit trails and validation checks to prevent data corruption and ensure business rule compliance.

#### 4.2.4 Availability

The system shall maintain high availability to ensure continuous access for users during business hours and minimize unplanned downtime. The target system availability shall be 99.5% measured monthly, allowing for approximately 3.6 hours of downtime per month including both planned maintenance and unplanned outages. Planned maintenance windows shall be scheduled during off-peak hours (weekends or after business hours) with advance notification to users. The system shall implement health monitoring with automated alerts for critical service failures, database connection issues, and resource exhaustion conditions. In the event of application server failure, the system shall provide clear error messages and estimated recovery time to users. Database replication or backup strategies shall be implemented to enable rapid recovery from data corruption or hardware failures, supporting the defined RTO of 4 hours.

#### 4.2.5 Security

The system shall implement comprehensive security controls to protect sensitive employee data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. Authentication shall support both Google OAuth 2.0 single sign-on and password-based login with minimum password requirements of 8 characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. All passwords shall be hashed using bcrypt with a minimum work factor of 10 before storage. Role-based access control (RBAC) shall enforce authorization policies with five distinct roles: Employee, HR Staff, Manager, Accountant, and Administrator, each with granular permissions. All production communications shall use HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ encryption, and sensitive data at rest shall be encrypted using AES-256 encryption.

The system shall implement structured logging using Logback with configurable log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG) and log rotation policies to facilitate troubleshooting without impacting performance. Database schema shall include proper indexing, foreign key constraints, and documentation of table relationships. Configuration parameters including database connections, API keys, and environment-specific settings shall be externalized in property files to enable deployment across different environments without code changes. The system shall maintain a mean time to repair (MTTR) of less than 4 hours for critical defects and less than 24 hours for non-critical issues.

#### 4.2.7 Scalability

The system shall be designed to accommodate growth in user base, data volume, and transaction load without requiring fundamental architectural changes. The application shall support horizontal scaling by deploying multiple Tomcat instances behind a load balancer to distribute user requests and increase concurrent user capacity. Database connection pooling with HikariCP shall be configured to optimize resource utilization and support increased transaction throughput as load increases.
